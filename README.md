Hi! 

<h1>Welcome to the Forecast App code.</h1>

<p>I made this project for educational purposes. <br>
It is a simple, sweet forecast App.</p>

I made this one using pure React. By developing it i have learned how to use React state, useEffect and other built in hooks. 
I have learned how to fetch data from API. 
I have also made my onw custom hook - useFetch - to handle data fetching using OpenWeather API. 
By utilizing this project i have also learned how Routing works. 
I have used optimalization techniques before upload such as React.memo and LazyLoading to group files into smaller chunks and get faster page load time. 

Features: 
 <ul>
  <li> 5 day upcoming Weather Forecast</li>
  <li> Contact form with field validation</li>
  <li> Custom hook to fetch data from API</li>
  <li> Dynamic rendered List of data</li>
</ul>

Please feel free to use this project
